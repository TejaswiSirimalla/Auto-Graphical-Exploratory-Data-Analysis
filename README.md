**Auto Graphical Exploratory Data Analysis** is an automated system designed to generate comprehensive graphical analysis of datasets, facilitating users in understanding the underlying structures and patterns in data, focused towards machine learning tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering.

**Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`, `bokeh`, `scikit-learn`, `math`, `statsmodels`, `os`, `warnings`

**Input**
> 1. Data present in either of the two file formats: csv, xlsx should be fed as input. <br>
> 2. If the input dataset is an excel file having more than one sheet, user is prompted with all the available sheets to enter the sheet containing the dataset for analysis.

**Reference Dataset used** : `Raisin` dataset from University of California, Irvine's ML repository [Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/850/raisin)
